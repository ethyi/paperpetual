# Paperpetual

Paper perpetual contracts (name subject to change).

US residents aren't allowed to trade perps and levered products due to regulatory reasons. 

As FCA states, these products cannot be reliably valued by retail consumers because of the: 

- inherent nature of the underlying assets, which means they have no reliable basis for valuation
- prevalence of market abuse and financial crime in the secondary market (e.g. cyber theft)
- extreme volatility in cryptoasset price movements
- inadequate understanding of cryptoassets by retail consumers
- lack of legitimate investment need for retail consumers to invest in these products

Anyways I wanted to make a perpetual future trading simulator to better understand how these products are structured, and how risky they actually are.

Being a paper trading app, I'm not limited to the confines of a single exchange, and therefore I am able to host pairs from all exchanges, both cex and dex.

WIP, implementation will likely persist data through cookies or a SOL wallet in devnet. Either way its going to be free.
